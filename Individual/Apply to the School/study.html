						   <h2><span>GRAPHIC DESIGN </span> (MFA)</h2>
                        </div>
						<div class="full">
						  <p>The graphic design program focuses on the development of a cohesive, investigative body of work, also known as the student’s thesis. At Yale, the graphic design thesis is conceived as a loose framework within which each student’s visual method is deployed across many diverse projects during the two-year course of study. While every thesis project is unique, there are several common features: a focus on methodology, the application of a visual method to studio work, and the organization of the work in a thoughtfully argued written document and “Thesis Book.”</br></br>
							The individual collection of graphic design work by each student is supported on several levels simultaneously: studio work led by faculty meeting weekly; small six-person thesis groups meeting biweekly; individual sessions with writing and editing tutors; and lectures, presentations, and workshops.</p>
					<h4>Credit Requirements</h4>
						<p>60 credits total are required to graduate. 42 credits in your area of concentration (including Art 949a, Critical Practice), and 18 additional credits, including a minimum of 6 academic credits which can be selected from throughout the University’s rich offerings.</p>

						   <h2><span>PAINTING AND PRINTMAKING </span> (MFA)</h2>
                        </div>
						<div class="full">
						  <p>Instruction in the program is rooted in the investigation of painting as a unique genre with its own complex syntax and history. Within this setting, the program encourages diversity of practice and interpretation, innovation, and experimentation.</br></br> 
						  Approximately twenty-one students are admitted each year. At the core of instruction are individual and group critiques with faculty, visiting critics, and visiting artists. In addition, students participate in a variety of seminars taught by both faculty and critics. The study of printmaking is integrated into the painting program, and a student may concentrate in painting, printmaking, or a combination of the two.Students work in individual 300-square-foot studios at 353 Crown Street adjacent to Green Hall.</p>

						<p>42 credits in area of concentration, including ART 949a, and 18 additional credits, including a minimum of 6 academic credits in courses outside the School of Art.</p>

						<div class="full">
						  <p>Photography is a two-year program of study admitting ten students a year. Darkroom, studio, and computer facilities are provided. Students receive technical instruction in black-and-white and color photography as well as nonsilver processes and digital image production.</br></br>
							The program is committed to a broad definition of photography as a lens-based medium open to a variety of expressive means. Students work both individually and in groups with faculty and visiting artists. In addition, a critique panel composed of faculty and other artists or critics meets weekly, as well as for a final review each term, to discuss student work.</p>

						   <h2><span>SCULPTURE </span> (MFA)</h2>
                        </div>
						<div class="full">
						<p>The sculpture program offers students the opportunity to develop their work in a supportive environment consisting of critical feedback in a broad array of diverse voices. The field of sculpture includes a varied collection of working methods and outcomes—one set of tools is not privileged over another—creating a healthy and experimental program that mirrors the issues facing artists outside of the institution. Students work independently in individual studio spaces and have access to common areas for the critique of their work. 36 Edgewood houses the sculpture program and has a woodworking shop, a metal shop, and a computer lab, while additional resources are offered by the School of Art and the University at large. No metal-casting or ceramic facilities are available.</p>

							<p>Critical Practice is not a formal area of study in the School of Art; however, the critical and theoretical elements undergirding the studio-based practice of students extends through multiple courses and initiatives offered throughout the School. These initiatives include ongoing cooperations with other professional schools and departments at the University that take the form of interdisciplinary workshops, international fellowships and residencies, seminar series, applied research projects, and extensive public programming—all of which seeks to engage multiple disciplines and a broader public in expanding the pedagogical framework surrounding the study of art.</p>

The School offers graduate video courses taught by practicing video artists. These classes address fundamental technical issues as well as the far more challenging questions of the contemporary practice of video by artists and this medium’s relation to other forms of art practice. Classes in video are taught in a variety of locations throughout the School of Art and are attended by students from all areas of study.</p>
