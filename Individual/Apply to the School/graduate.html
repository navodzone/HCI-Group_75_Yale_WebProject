						<h4>References and supporting documents</h4>
						  <p>While references and TOEFL scores (if applicable) may continue to be received after the January 5th deadline, review of applications begins soon thereafter. Applicants are thus urged to impress upon those writing reference letters, or submitting items on their behalf, that the timely submission of such documents is critical to guarantee inclusion in the admission committee’s review.
							Please also note that upon entering an individual as a reference in the application system, a reference request and URL to upload the recommendation letter is automatically sent to the recipient’s email. Applicants who decide to remove a specific reference from their application must notify that individual directly as the link will become inactive.
							The non-refundable fee to apply is $100. Please note that Yale School or Art practices need-blind admission therefore we do not waive admission application fees.</p>
						</div></br>
                    </div>
					<div class="full">
						<h4>Application Status</h4>
						  <p>Due to the high volume of incoming applications and processing which will be happening remotely this cycle, our office is unable to provide application status checks or confirm the receipt of items by phone or by email. Applicants should familiarize themselves with their Yale admission status page (accessed by logging into the application system) which will indicate outstanding items.
							Receipt of items submitted by digital upload is updated in real time on the application status page checklist. Please allow one week for credentials received by postal mail to be reflected in the status page.</p>

						   <h2><span>ADMISSION </span></h2>
                        </div>
						<div class="full">
						  <p>Students are admitted to Yale’s MFA for the Fall semester of each year only. Applicants are notified of the admission committee’s decisions on preliminary selections in February, and final decisions in early March. No information about decisions will be given over the phone or advance of the batch written release to all finalists. To apply for more than one area of concentration, separate applications, fees, 
						  and supporting documentation must be submitted. The work submitted should be representative of the applicant’s experience in that particular field. Applying to more than one program does not increase an applicant’s chances of selection.</br></br>
							<b>Please note: Yale School of Art does not practice admission deferment; An offer of admission for Fall 2021 is valid only for enrollment for that year regardless of the in-residence conditions of the Yale campus at that time. Applicants who are offered admission but choose not to enroll are welcome to reapply to the School in a future cycle.</p> </br>

							<p>APPLICATION DEADLINE: Online applications for programs beginning in the 2020–2021 academic year must be uploaded no later than 11:59:59 PM EST on January 5, 2021. Applicants will not be allowed to submit materials or applications after the deadline has passed. Please note that when many applicants are uploading simultaneously near the deadline, it is possible that lengthier processing times will be experienced. To avoid this, please consider submitting prior to the deadline day.</p>

						<h4>Admission Procedures for Preliminary Selection</h4>
						  <p>An application to the School of Art requires forethought and planning. It is important to read all of the application instructions carefully. Following these instructions will ensure that your application is viewed to best advantage.</p>
						</div></br>
						<h4>Application materials</h4>
						<p>Yale School of Art, in our commitment to equity and access, practices “need blind admission”; meaning that, candidate financial need or ability is never disclosed to the admission committee during review of MFA applications. For this reason, and because the processing and careful review of each individual application demands great time and human resources, we regret that the School does not waive the application fee under any circumstances.</br>
								
							</br><b>1.A one-page statement that addresses influences, interests, current work direction, brief life history (as it relates to art/design practice), and reasons for applying to graduate school at this time. Statements should be limited to one page or no more than 500 words.</b></br></br>
							
							Applicants to the Painting/Printmaking program should make reference in their statements to the “representative work” in the portfolio; this is not critical for the other programs.</br>

								
							</br><b>1.References from three persons practicing or teaching in the field in which application is made, attesting to the applicant’s ability and competence in that field.</b></br></br>
							
							NOTE: The admissions committee reviews applications shortly after the deadline. While it is not uncommon for letters of recommendation to come in past the January 5th deadline, please impress upon on those who will be writing on your behalf, that late submission of supporting documentation may risk exclusion from the review. Applicants can always view the receipt status of reference requests on the application status page.</br></br>
							
							<h4>Transcripts</h4> of academic record for the bachelor’s degree and/or professional art schools attended. Student/unofficial copies may be uploaded to the application for the preliminary jury. Official transcripts will ONLY be required for applicants invited to interview. If invited to interview, official transcripts should be mailed to: Yale School of Art Admissions, POB 208339, New Haven, CT 06520-8339. Neither junior college transcripts nor Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are required.
							</br></br><h4>Portfolio of work</h4> Applicants who fail to upload a portfolio as outlined by the stated deadline will NOT be considered. The portfolio should represent images of your best work, indicate your current direction, and demonstrate your ability. At least half of the images should represent work done within the last twelve months, and all should be from within the last three years. Chronological order of year is embedded in our system, and you will not be able to override it. 
							The application system used by Yale requires that one image from the portfolio be designated as a “representative work.” This selection is simply the default image for the cover page of each application file. As such, applicants have historically selected the piece which most strongly represents ideas central to their current body of work.

							Do not include more than one image on the screen, nor embed other pages of a publication or video within the images you place in your portfolio. Do not include detail photos of work in your portfolio unless you consider them absolutely necessary. Under no circumstances should more than two detail shots be included. Portfolio requirements differ depending upon area of concentration; be sure to follow the instructions for the area to which you are applying. We strongly recommend that you review your images on a Mac OS to be certain that they are accurately represented.

							NOTE: All supporting documents that are submitted as a requirement for admission become a part of the official file and cannot be returned to the applicant or forwarded to another institution either in copy or original form.

						<h4>International students MUST use their passport name on all application materials.</h4>
						  <p>In order to undertake graduate study, all international students and others for whom English is not their first language must present evidence of competence in the use of the English language. This may be done by taking the Internet-based Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL iBT), which is administered by the Educational Testing Service, www.ets.org. The TOEFL code number for the Yale School of Art is 3982. Candidates for admission generally achieve a 
						  composite Internet-based score of at least 100, or a computer-based score of at least 250, with speaking and listening scores of at least 28. If the TOEFL iBT is not available in your area, you are required to complete the TOEFL that is available plus you are required to take the Test of Spoken English (TSE). A minimum TOEFL score of 550 is generally achieved for the pbt. Although we have no official cut-off, you will have difficulty in an intensive program such 
						  as ours without a level of language proficiency appropriate for graduate study. IELTS test scores may be accepted with a minimum score of 7. The TOEFL score may be waived if the undergraduate degree has been obtained from a four-year, English-speaking institution.</p> </br> 
						  
						  <p> In order to receive visa documentation, admitted international students must submit proof that income from all sources will be sufficient to meet expenses for two years of study. The full cost of attendance expenses for the current academic year, 2020-21 (including tuition) is $64,297 for a single student. Evidence of funds may come from the following sources:</br></br>

								<b>1.Affidavit from a bank;</br>
								2.Copy of an award letter stating that financial assistance has been offered;</br>
								3.Certification by parents of their ability and intention to provide the necessary funds;</br>
								4.Certification by employer of anticipated income.</br>
								5.All international students who wish to be appointed as teaching assistants during their second year must obtain a United States Social Security number in order to be paid.<b></br>

						<div class="full">
						<p>Once an application has been submitted, applicants can track the status of their application and the receipt of required supporting materials (such as recommendations) online. Applicants are encouraged to check the status of their application materials and follow up as necessary.</p>
						<h4>Final Selection</h4>
						  <p>Applicants who have passed the Preliminary Selection Jury will be notified in early February. At this time, applicants invited to interview are required to submit official transcripts and send or prepare to bring original work to the School. Individual interviews will be scheduled for mid-late February, depending on the program. The interview is an important component of the final selection process.</p> </br> 
						<h4>Guidelines for Interview</h4>  
						  <p> <b>Applicants in Graphic Design </b> should prepare a portfolio of their work in any or all of these areas: graphic design print work, environmental design, broadcast/video graphics, letterform design, interactive media, and other related projects in the visual arts. Applicants are encouraged to present bodies of work that demonstrate special areas of interest. Academic or research papers may also be submitted in support of the application. For two year program applicants at least 12 examples of physical work and for the preliminary program at least 10 examples of physical work may be presented at interview.</br></br>
						  <p><b>Applicants in Painting/Printmaking </b>should submit no more than four artworks and four drawings, studies, graphic works, or videos (these are not required to be pieces that were in your application portfolio). For 2021 applicants should prepare a PDF of these works and provide them to the admissions committee.</br></br>
						  <p><b>Applicants in Photography </b>prepare a portfolio of no more than 20 un-matted photographic proofs which are no larger than 20 X 24 inches each.</br></br>
						  <p><b>Applicants in Sculpture </b>prepare digital files that document the individual’s latest work as well as additional images representing earlier work. Additional documentation to the work in your preliminary portfolio may be brought to your interview (include with portfolio images on a thumb drive for your presentation).Please do not bring any objects for your presentation as the process of setting up takes away from interview time.</p> </br> 
						   <p><b>All Applicants </b>All original works shipped to Yale should be accompanied by a complete inventory, and each work should bear the applicant’s name.</br></br>
						
							<h4>Final notification of admission</h4>
							<p>Final notification of admission will be e-mailed in early March. Offers of admission are good only for the year in which they are made. We do not practice deferred admission. The Financial Aid Award letter will be e-mailed shortly after notification of admission. No decisions will be given in person or over the telephone.
							An individual’s acceptance of admission to the School of Art must be received by April 1. All matriculating students must submit a transcript that certifies their undergraduate degree. Admission is not binding unless this certification is received.</p>

						  <p>The School of Art requires for admission a high degree of capability and commitment. Applicants must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university or a diploma from a four-year accredited professional art school. In exceptional cases and most particularly in light of the differences among educational structures and opportunities in the international art world today, the admissions committee may waive these prerequisites if other proofs of preparation and accomplishment are deemed sufficient equivalents by the committee. In either case, admission to the School of Art is on a highly selective and competitive basis.</p> </br>
